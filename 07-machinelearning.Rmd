# Machine Learning Concepts

## Introduction

Have you ever asked yourself what is the difference between **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**? What about between **supervised** and **unsupervised learning**? Well, that's not surprising at all because trying to find out the right answer within the huge ocean of information that is the Internet, can become a really daunting task. 

In this post, we will try first to define the most widely used Machine Learning concepts and finally trying to give clarifying examples of each one of them to try to help in the understanding of their meanings.

## Artificial Intelligence vs. Machine Learning

What is the difference between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning? **Artificial Intelligence** is the concept of machines being able to perform tasks in a way that we would consider "smart". **Machine Learning** however is the current application of AI, where we just give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves (source [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/12/06/what-is-the-difference-between-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/)).

The Machine Learning concept comprises different techniques whereby it is possible to make machines learning from diverse sets of data. Among the most important ones, we can highlight **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**.

## Supervised learning

When the training data - the data we want machines learning about - comprises not only the input vectors but also their corresponding target vectors.

### Classification

Classification is a supervised learning method used when the target vectors consist of a finite number of discrete categories.

The *iris* dataset available in R, for instance, can be used in classification problems because it provides different input vectors (*"Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length" and "Petal.With"*) and a target vector (*"Species"*) with a finite number of categories (*"setosa", "versicolor" and "virginica"*).

```R
> summary(iris)
  Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width          Species  
 Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100   setosa    :50  
 1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300   versicolor:50  
 Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300   virginica :50  
 Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199                  
 3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800                  
 Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500  
```

### Regression

Regression is also a supervised learning method but only used when the target vectors consist of one or more continuous variables.

The *longley* R dataset is an example of this type of data. It presents a collection of inputs vectors (*"GNP.deflator", "GNP", "Unemployed", "Armed.Forces", "Population", "Year"*) and a numeric vector output (*"Employed"*).

```R
> summary(longley)
  GNP.deflator         GNP          Unemployed     Armed.Forces     Population         Year         Employed    
 Min.   : 83.00   Min.   :234.3   Min.   :187.0   Min.   :145.6   Min.   :107.6   Min.   :1947   Min.   :60.17  
 1st Qu.: 94.53   1st Qu.:317.9   1st Qu.:234.8   1st Qu.:229.8   1st Qu.:111.8   1st Qu.:1951   1st Qu.:62.71  
 Median :100.60   Median :381.4   Median :314.4   Median :271.8   Median :116.8   Median :1954   Median :65.50  
 Mean   :101.68   Mean   :387.7   Mean   :319.3   Mean   :260.7   Mean   :117.4   Mean   :1954   Mean   :65.32  
 3rd Qu.:111.25   3rd Qu.:454.1   3rd Qu.:384.2   3rd Qu.:306.1   3rd Qu.:122.3   3rd Qu.:1958   3rd Qu.:68.29  
 Max.   :116.90   Max.   :554.9   Max.   :480.6   Max.   :359.4   Max.   :130.1   Max.   :1962   Max.   :70.55  
```
## Unsupervised learning

When the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The main aim of unsupervised learning problems can be summarised in the following ideas.

### Clustering

Grouping the input data that share different similarities into clusters - called **clustering** (a widely known clustering algorithm is [K-Means](https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/handouts/kmeans.html)). Below, an example dataset which can be used in a clustering problem:

```R
> library(cluster.datasets)
> data(acidosis.patients)
> summary(acidosis.patients)
 ph.cerebrospinal.fluid    ph.blood     hco3.cerebrospinal.fluid   hco3.blood    co2.cerebrospinal.fluid   co2.blood    
 Min.   :38.50          Min.   :32.80   Min.   : 9.80            Min.   : 4.20   Min.   :17.80           Min.   :12.90  
 1st Qu.:45.67          1st Qu.:37.20   1st Qu.:19.43            1st Qu.:19.00   1st Qu.:40.38           1st Qu.:30.25  
 Median :48.05          Median :39.55   Median :22.65            Median :23.30   Median :45.25           Median :35.70  
 Mean   :47.52          Mean   :41.55   Mean   :21.91            Mean   :22.72   Mean   :45.57           Mean   :36.44  
 3rd Qu.:49.45          3rd Qu.:41.98   3rd Qu.:24.52            3rd Qu.:26.93   3rd Qu.:52.58           3rd Qu.:42.30  
 Max.   :54.90          Max.   :81.30   Max.   :30.40            Max.   :34.80   Max.   :69.00           Max.   :61.40  
```

### Density estimation

Determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as **density estimation**. In other words, the aim of density estimation is to use statistical models to find an underlying probability distribution that is the main reason of the observed variables. A widely known density estimation algorithm is Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). Although KDE algorithm has a very intimidating name, it can be used to visualize the continuous "shape" of some data instead of using its discrete version through a histogram.

### Visualization

This unsupervised method consist of projecting the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of **visualization**.
